# old_tweets
This is a very simple scraper that pulls the basic information for tweets matching a specific query within a specified time range. It does not use the twitter API. Instead, it uses Selenium to submit the query to twitter and load all the result by scrolling to the bottom of the page. It then parses the page using beautifulsoup.
